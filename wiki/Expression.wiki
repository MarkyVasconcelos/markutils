#summary A way to resolve Math expressions as String in java.
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

In java, we don't have anything like the eval from JavaScript. So.. I created a way.

To use is very simple.

{{{
Expression exp = new Expression("(15+5)*8+(5-6/(5+5))");  
double result = exp.resolve(); 
}}}

And to make easier to parse string after instantiate the class you can set variables like:

{{{
Expression exp = new Expression("(x+x+x)*5");  
exp.setVariable("x", 3);  
double result = exp.resolve(); 
}}}


Very simple, dont?
